      article_content: "<h2>Is your cat spending too much time on Reddit looking at Crypto?</h2>\n<p>Here are 5 reasons why cats love crypto:</p>\n<h3>1. Cats Are Crypto-Addicts! - Crypto (Cryptocurrency) Is Like Digital Gold</h3>\n<p>Cats have always been known to be &ldquo;crypto-addicted&rdquo;. Crypto brings them all kinds of good things. There are many aspects of cryptocurrency that make it similar to gold. Both are scarce, durable, and valuable. In fact, cryptos are even referred to as digital gold because they behave similarly to physical gold. One cannot just make any amount of crypto coins; only certain amounts of them can be generated each time. Only 21 million Bitcoins were ever created. So how does this relate to cats? Well, in order to get their paws on some crypto coins, cats need to chase after those who mined them. This means these cats are working harder than us to earn their crypto rewards. It would appear that not only do cats want what we have, but they also want what we have worked hard to obtain.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;<br />2. Cats Love Crypto Because It Promotes Healthy Lifestyle Choices</h3>\n<p>With its decentralized nature, crypto allows people worldwide to live without borders or restrictions. This is especially true for those living in countries where fiat currency is restricted. The freedom crypto provides makes it possible for people to travel and conduct business wherever they wish, at any time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is no surprise that a significant number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts work from home. Cryptocurrency gives people the flexibility to choose where to work and how long they want to work. Many people use crypto as payment for services such as web design, programming, and consulting. Additionally, many people spend much of their day reading about the latest developments in blockchain technology. These types of activities allow individuals to maximize their productivity while minimizing stress levels.</p>\n<h3><br />3. Crypto Encourages Community Involvement</h3>\n<p>Cats enjoy interacting with others just like humans do. They may follow other felines around a house, play together, groom each other and share food with one another.</p>\n<p>All of these relationships are fostered by crypto communities. Crypto communities encourage people to get involved and help out fellow members. They also enable community members to interact and socialize with one another.<br />&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>4. Crypto Helps Build Bonds Between Humans, Animals &amp; Nature</h3>\n<p>Crypto encourages people to care for the natural environment. By using it as digital money, people become aware of the damage done to the earth due to human greed and exploitation. When cryptocurrency users donate to environmental groups, they also gain knowledge about the value of the world's land, water, and air. If people really cared about animals, they would stop eating meat and killing wildlife.</p>\n<h3><br />&nbsp;5. Crypto Allows People To Be Kind And Generous</h3>\n<p>Crypto enables people to contribute to causes they believe in. Through various charitable donations, they can support organizations such as homeless shelters and animal shelters. They can also sponsor causes they feel passionate about. All the money collected adds to the total sum of cryptocurrencies. This results in more money being raised for a particular cause. Thus, crypto creates opportunities for people to be generous and kind.</p>"

      article_content: "<h2>1. What is crypto?</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency is digital money that uses cryptography (a mathematical system) to secure transactions and verify users. Cryptography secures data by making it nearly impossible to read without access to special keys. In addition to securing information, cryptography can be programmed to work automatically, opening up the possibility of micropayments and other applications.</p>\n<h2>2. How do I buy cryptocurrency?</h2>\n<p>You can purchase cryptocurrencies using a credit card at Coinbase. You can fund your account using a bank wire transfer or debit/credit cards. Once your account is funded, you can then start buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many others.</p>\n<h2>3. Where can I spend my coins?</h2>\n<p>You can use your cryptocurrency anywhere that accepts traditional currency. Most merchants in America have started accepting bitcoin, including Microsoft, Subway, Walmart, Dell Computers, Home Depot, New Egg, Lending Club, Square, and even Starbucks! There are even some exchanges that allow you to exchange your bitcoins for cash instantly. Check out our list of 100+ places where you can spend your coins.</p>\n<h2>4. Is crypto right for me?</h2>\n<p>If you are looking to make long-term investments and not just play around with cryptocurrencies, we recommend checking out our friends at Future Advisor who focus on high-yield dividend stocks and ETFs. We&rsquo;ve been compensated for promoting them here but understand their track records and strategies.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

      article_content: "<p>With economic times ahead uncertain, you may be doing all the right things to reduce your spend, but still struggling to save as much as you'd like. Here are some unique ways to save a bit more cash.</p>\n<h2>1. Grow your own food</h2>\n<p>Growing your own food is not only good for the environment, but it&rsquo;s also cheaper than buying pre-packaged foods at the store. You can grow fresh herbs, vegetables, fruits, and even flowers right in your backyard! Not only does it save money, but it&rsquo;ll also give you access to produce that isn&rsquo;t available in stores. If you live in a city, you may have trouble finding certain types of produce, but if you live in a rural area, you should have no problem finding what you need.</p>\n<h2>2. Buy in bulk</h2>\n<p>Buying in bulk means you&rsquo;re paying less per unit. Buying in bulk saves money over time because you won&rsquo;t have to spend money on packaging and shipping fees. When you buy in bulk, you&rsquo;re also able to get discounts on the products you purchase.</p>\n<h2>3. Shop sales</h2>\n<p>Sale season is here again! Shopping sales gives you great deals on everything from clothing to electronics. There are many online shopping websites out there that offer great sales throughout the year. Check the website regularly to find the best deals.</p>\n<h2>4. Use coupons</h2>\n<p>Coupons are a great way to save money while still getting exactly what you want. Coupon codes are available for almost anything and they can help you save a lot of money. Make sure to check the coupon code before purchasing something though, just in case the coupon doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>\n<h2>5. Donate old clothes</h2>\n<p>Donating your old clothes is a great way to save some extra cash. Most thrift shops accept donations, but you might have to do a little bit of cleaning first. You can either drop off your items at a local thrift shop or donate them to Goodwill.</p>\n<h2>6. Sell things online</h2>\n<p>There are many sites that allow you to sell your unwanted items for cheap. eBay is one of the most popular sites that people use to sell their goods. You can make anywhere from $20 to $100 selling your items. Just make sure to list the item correctly and thoroughly describe it.</p>"

      article_content: "<h2>1. You're spending money on things that don't work</h2>\n<p>It's no secret that many people spend money on products that promise to help them grow their business without actually working. These are called 'get rich quick' schemes and they almost always fail. If someone tells you that you can make thousands of dollars per week just by using some product, chances are he's trying to sell you something. Don't fall victim to these tactics, invest your time and money wisely!</p>\n<h2>2. You're not taking advantage of what you have</h2>\n<p>You may think that you already know everything there is to know about marketing online, but if you want to really succeed then you need to learn how to market yourself effectively. Too often we use social media platforms to share our lives instead of focusing on building our brand. We post pictures of ourselves eating unhealthy food or drinking expensive coffee while wearing designer clothing. We talk about our problems and struggles, which makes us seem weak and vulnerable. When was the last time you saw someone who looked happy? People buy from those who build relationships; they don't want to feel like they're being sold to.</p>\n<h2>3. You're not investing in yourself</h2>\n<p>When you put off learning new skills and investing in yourself, you'll find that you lack the confidence to take action towards your goals. You'll also struggle to attract high-quality clients because you won't be able to provide the best service possible. So what do you need to start doing right now to improve your financial situation?</p>"
